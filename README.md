==============

Minimal surfaces (complex, algebraic, smooth). The title of this git repo is no longer correct.
We also look at surfaces that are not of general type.

After cloning the repo, run `python *.py` to create a database.
 The database will contain a table with invariants, and a table with bibliographic information about surfaces.
